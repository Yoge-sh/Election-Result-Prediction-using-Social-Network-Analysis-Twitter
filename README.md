## Result and Conclusions
ðŸ“Œ Both candidate have RELATIVELY same no. of tweets so we can assume somewhat same engagement from both sides.

ðŸ“Œ Though if we see the negative polarity score is more for Rahul Gandhi's tweets than Narendra Modi's tweets, It may be beneficial for both the sides as RG is the leader of opposition and NaMo was present PM, But POSITIVE APPROACH OF MODI'S TWEETS MAY BE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN RAHUL GANDHI'S NEGATIVE TWEETS.

ðŸ“Œ If we see by using Vader Sentiments on raw data, we see that positive tweets percentage for Narendra Modi is more than Rahul Gandhi (though slightly)

ðŸ“Œ No. of tweets mentioning about Rahul Gandhi (14148) is very less than Narendra Modi(25683)

ðŸ“Œ If we see analysis with get_nrc_sentiment (R library) we see there is sudden difference between Disgust and joy curve in Narendra Modi but it almost same in case of Rahul Gandhi
So if we consider only on the twitter data we can say that Narendra Modi is ahead of Rahul Gandhi in terms of twitter popularity, overall polarity and audience engagement.
So all the way it goes into favor of Narendra Modi.

**Hence chances of Narendra Modi to win the election was more than Rahul Gandhi.**
